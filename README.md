# OFDM-system-performing



In this project, we developed a simulation of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system that employs Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation. The system was tested in the presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to analyze its performance. The simulation was implemented using MATLAB, and it involved generating a random data source that was transmitted using four subcarriers. Instead of using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT), we used the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) and Inverse Fractional Fourier Transform (IFRFT) to perform the subcarrier modulation and demodulation. We also added a cyclic prefix to the signal and calculated the noise power spectral density. After transmitting the signal, we simulated the received signal by adding complex noise with N0 power spectral density. Next, we removed the cyclic prefix from the received signal and performed FRFT to obtain the reconstructed signal. We then demodulated the reconstructed signal and calculated the Symbol Error Rate (SER) and Bit Error Rate (BER). Finally, we plotted the SER and BER versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and provided a legend for the plot.
